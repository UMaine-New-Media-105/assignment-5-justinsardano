assignment 1 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/sPAaOFd7f For this assignment, I created five bubbles that jitter around randomly. I did this by making a class, which had the information to easily create five separate objects in the sketch. 
assignment 2 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/dkNzv3WMc For this assignment, I created the same concept as in the first assignment, which was to create bubbles that jittered, but this time, I created 50. I did this by adding loops and arrays that would create 50 individual objects, which is possible through the class.
