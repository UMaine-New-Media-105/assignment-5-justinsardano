assignment 1 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/sPAaOFd7f For this assignment, I created five bubbles that jitter around randomly. I did this by making a class, which had the information to easily create five separate objects in the sketch. 
assignment 2 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/dkNzv3WMc For this assignment, I created the same concept as in the first assignment, which was to create bubbles that jittered, but this time, I created 50. I did this by adding loops and arrays that would create 50 individual objects, which is possible through the class. 
assignment 3 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/Xv4y8mk-lm for this assignment, I created the basic layout for my simulation, which is a space theme. I made the particles stars, the breeders satellites, and the catchers UFOs. I made a class for each piece of the sim, and created 50 particles that jittered, and then 25 breeders and 2 catchers that moved back and forth. Once the breeders and the catchers hit the borders, they would respawn at a different random y coordinate, which I did by adding the random y coordinate after the if statement. For the rest of the sim, I was able to display it and move it through the class, using both loops and arrays to create the piece.   
assignment 4 link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/Xv4y8mk-lm For this part of the assignment, I created a second loop and certain variables that allowed the Breeder to breed. I did this by creating a new loop, and then creating an if statement that adds a new Breeder if two Breeders collide. I also created a spawn delay, because I didn't want to spawn a ridiculous amount.
